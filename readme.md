This is a (vanilla) javascript implementation of the popular mobile game '2048'. The aim is to get the 2048 tile by combining matching tiles. Tiles are moved by either pressing the arrow buttons below or pressing the arrow buttons on your keyboard.

I'm looking to add different variations of the original game and make it different from the hundreds of other clones that now exist.

Features:
- Changeable grid size from 3x3 up to 10x10
- Simple automated solver
